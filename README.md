# Terraform time conversion module

This module allows you to input a time duration in various units (nanoseconds to weeks) and retrieve the equivalent value in a different unit within the same range.

Using this module, you can define time durations in a human-readable format and convert them as needed, ensuring consistency and clarity in your Terraform configurations.
